# MCSongExtractor
A simple extractor that helps get songs from Minecraft mods
Although this tool is cool keep in mind that some modders may not want their music extracted.
# YOU WILL NEED NODE.JS AND ADMZIP
To run you will need to set the paths in the code, once you have it ensure it looks something like this:
"C:/Users/thepronightgamer/documents/test/"
Make sure that the paths end with a "/".
